<p>ARIMA is a type of model widely used in time series problems, for exemple to predict sales or stocks.</p>

<p>The learning curve for this model is steep at the beginning; the time to understand the difference between autocorelation and moving average take a while. Even when you fit your first model, you canâ€™t say that you master all the subtleties of the exercise.</p>

<p>To understand it, it needed me <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/S%C3%A9ries-temporelles-avec-M%C3%A9thodes-cas/dp/2817802071/277-5178286-1463028?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=duckduckgo-ffnt-fr-21">that book</a> that only french reader can understand and <a href="http://alstatr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/r-explore-arima2-2-2-subclass-family-on.html">that shiny app</a> to finally be comfortable  to implement ARIMA model in a professional environment. That <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim2.htm">web site</a>, also, is a great resource.</p>

<p>The ARIMA picker is an add-in made to help to speed the learning curve, mainly by making the simulation and analysis steps faster.</p>

<p>The app is a simplification of the app of @allstatr, to make it fast to run and light to load.</p>

<p>To launch the app as an add-in, you need a recent version of Rstudio(v0.99.878 or later).
Otherwise, you still could enjoy the <code class="highlighter-rouge">arimaUI</code> function.</p>

<p>To install the add-in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">devtools</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">install_github</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"YvesCR/arimaUI"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The best way to familiarize yourself with the function is to play with it.
For exemple by simulating in a blind way the components of your time serie:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="c1"># simulation of the components (p, d, q). 
</span><span class="n">order.blind</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">floor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">runif</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># For ARIMA models with differencing, the differenced series follows a zero-mean ARMA model
</span><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">order.blind</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">order.blind</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="m">0</span>

<span class="c1"># simulation of the parameters
</span><span class="n">ar.blind</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">runif</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">order.blind</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="m">-1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ma.blind</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">runif</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">order.blind</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="m">-1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># below 50 points, finding the correct components is challenging.
</span><span class="n">sim.ts</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">arima.sim</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">order.blind</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">ar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ar.blind</span>
<span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ma</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ma.blind</span>
<span class="p">))</span>

<span class="n">list.res</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">arimaUI</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sim.ts</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If the numbers of the components that you pick in the end is equal to the ones which had been randomly selected, you are truly skilled, congratulations.</p>

<p>To note, when the coefficients are near 0, there is simply no way to guess them. It is indeed a tricky game.</p>
